# Response Generation System: Implementation Approaches

## Overview

This document outlines various approaches for building an automated response generation system for the Weibo AI experiment. Each approach is evaluated based on feasibility, scalability, cost, and ease of implementation.

## Key Requirements

1. **Group Management**: Assign users to 5 different experimental groups
2. **Response Generation**: Create contextually appropriate responses based on:
   - Account type (AI-declared vs Human-roleplay)
   - Context awareness (with/without posting history)
3. **Scheduling**: Post responses 2-3 times per week
4. **Tracking**: Monitor interventions and collect engagement metrics
5. **Scale**: Handle 226 users across 5 groups

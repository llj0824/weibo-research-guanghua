# Checkpoint 3: Triggering Post Sheet Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide explains the new Triggering Post sheet feature that separates triggering posts from historical posts, providing better control over which posts trigger AI responses.

## What's New in Checkpoint 3

### New Features:
1. **Triggering Post Sheet** - A dedicated sheet containing one post per user that will trigger AI responses
2. **Pull Latest Posts Button** - Automatically populates the Triggering Post sheet with the most recent post from each user
3. **Non-blocking Error Handling** - Missing posts show warnings but don't stop generation for other users

### Architecture:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│      TRIGGERING POST Sheet      │    │         POSTS Sheet             │
│ (One latest post per user)      │◄───│ (All historical posts)          │
│                                 │    │                                 │
│  [🔄 Pull Latest Posts] button  │    │                                 │

                    │                                    │
                    └──────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                                   ▼
                         ┌──────────────────┐
                         │ getPostForUser() │
                         │  Reads trigger   │
                         │  from Triggering │
                         │  Post, history   │
                         │  from Posts      │
                         └──────────────────┘
```

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy the Updated Script

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Go to Extensions → Apps Script
3. Replace the existing code with the contents of `AppScript_checkpoint_3.js`
4. Save the script (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
5. Close the Apps Script editor
6. Refresh your Google Sheet

### Step 2: Create Triggering Post Sheet

You have two options:

**Option A: Automatic Creation**
1. Try to generate responses without the sheet
2. When prompted "Triggering Post sheet not found!", click "Yes" to create it and pull latest posts

**Option B: Manual Creation via Menu**
1. Click "🤖 Response System" → "🔄 Pull Latest Posts for All Users"
2. The sheet will be created automatically and populated with latest posts

### Step 3: Verify Setup

1. Check that "Triggering Post" sheet exists with these columns:
   - user_id, post_id, post_link, post_publish_time, post_content, etc.
2. Verify it contains one post per user (the latest post)
3. The Posts sheet remains unchanged (contains all historical posts)

## How It Works

### Pull Latest Posts Function:
```javascript
// When you click "🔄 Pull Latest Posts for All Users":
1. Reads all users from Users sheet
2. Scans Posts sheet for all posts
3. Finds the most recent post for each user (by publish_time)
4. Populates Triggering Post sheet with one row per user
5. Shows summary: "✅ Updated 225 users! ⚠️ 1 user has no posts"
```

### Response Generation Flow:
```javascript
// When generating responses:
1. Check Triggering Post sheet for the trigger post
2. If found → use it as the triggering post
3. If not found → skip user with warning (non-blocking)
4. Get historical posts from Posts sheet (excluding the trigger)
5. Groups 2 & 4 receive historical context, others don't
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Control**: You can manually edit which post triggers responses
2. **Consistency**: All responses for a user use the same triggering post
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to refresh all triggers with one button click
4. **Non-blocking**: Missing posts don't stop other users from being processed
5. **Transparency**: Clear separation between trigger and history

## Common Operations

### Refresh All Triggering Posts:
```
Menu → 🤖 Response System → 🔄 Pull Latest Posts for All Users
```

### Manually Change a Triggering Post:
1. Go to Triggering Post sheet
2. Find the user's row
3. Edit the post_content or other fields directly
4. Changes take effect immediately

### Handle Missing Posts:
If users are being skipped:
1. Check if they have posts in the Posts sheet
2. Run "🔄 Pull Latest Posts for All Users" to update
3. Or manually add their triggering post to the sheet

## Troubleshooting

### "Triggering Post sheet not found!"
- Click "Yes" when prompted to create it automatically
- Or use menu: "🔄 Pull Latest Posts for All Users"

### Users being skipped during generation
- Check the alert message for specific user names/IDs
- Verify these users have posts in the Posts sheet
- Run "Pull Latest Posts" to refresh

### Wrong post being used as trigger
- Check Triggering Post sheet for that user
- The system uses whatever is in this sheet
- Edit directly or re-pull to update

## Migration from Checkpoint 2

No data migration needed! Your existing setup remains intact:
- Posts sheet: Unchanged, still contains all posts
- Response Queue: Same format, continues to work
- Users/Prompts: No changes needed

Simply deploy the new script and start using the enhanced features.

## Next Steps

1. Test with a small group of users first
2. Verify triggering posts are appropriate for your research
3. Consider manually curating triggering posts for specific users if needed
4. Monitor Response Queue to ensure quality
